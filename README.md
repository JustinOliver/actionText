"# actionText" 
A text based game written in Python
Not a very fun game. Actually quite boring. I wouldn't recommend playing it.
I nerfed it pretty hard for testing purposes so that I didn't actually have to play.
But it does function like it should.
I just created it as a way to develop and test some skills.
